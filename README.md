# the._.onlybraincell
A brutally honest, chaotic personal site by the last working brain cell. Blogs, projects, diary rants, and overshared thoughts—served with raw HTML/CSS/JS. Responsive, minimal, and mildly unhinged. Built without frameworks, powered by ✨ vibes ✨ and pure internet chaos. By Aditya Mishra, Built with AI.
